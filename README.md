One commonly used algorithm in C++ is quicksort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array or list of items.

This program demonstrates the use of the quicksort algorithm for sorting both arrays of integers and vectors of strings.

The quicksort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array or list of items. The program contains two implementations of quicksort, one for sorting arrays of integers and one for sorting vectors of strings.

The main function of the program creates both an array of integers and a vector of strings, and then calls the appropriate quicksort function to sort each. The sorted arrays are then printed to the console.

This program provides a useful example of how the quicksort algorithm can be implemented in C++ and applied to different types of data.

You can use this script as a starting point for your own projects or to learn more about the quicksort algorithm.

Please note that in the second example, the comparison should be based on the string's ASCII value and not the string comparison operator.

Also, if you want to apply this algorithm to different types of data, you should create another implementation of the quicksort function adapted to the type of data you want to sort.
